			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
				During most of my life I have lived in the North West Ohio area for
				most of my Life in a small city called Defiance. I currently go to
				a school called Four County Career Center, but my home school is
				Ayersville Pilots. At Four County I take a the Software Development 
				and Game Design class in the I.T Department. During my time at Four
				County I have learned that the Java programming and I do not get along.
				However when we do Web programming, Sql programming, and Game programming
				with the Greenfoot Aplication, I do ok in those areas of coding. Besides
				from school I also work at Mcdonalds in Defiance for over a year now.
				During this school year I have made many new friends both at work and at
				school.
