			<h2>other</h2>
			<p>
				During the school year I try to do what I can to make
				sure that I have no late assignments, no missing assignments,
				and no incomplete assignments. However as I try to make sure
				that none of this happens it always does, which makes me feel	
				disappointed about myself at the end of the week when it happens.
				When I don't have anything to do and I am busy doing something
				like being at work, I try to keep myself occupied as much as possible.

			<h2>During the Summer</h2>
			<p>
				During the summer I try to do what I can to keep myself occupied,
				wether that is either reading, drawing, writing, sleeping, watching
				videos on social media, or playing video games. Sometimes during the
				summer I go to work at Mcdonalds.
