							In Lab I am currently working on My quarter 2 project, and both 
							web and java assignments. As of Write now I am working on Both my
							Project and this Web Cite that I have built. Still Since the start
							of the school year I have learned many things. Also For my Web Page
							I have Built Myself a logo which you may have seen around my Web 
							Cite already but here is a picture of what it looks like.<br><br>

						<h1>Projects</h1>
							The Main big Project that I have been Working on would be my Quarter 
							2 Project wich will be sometime after thanksgiving. What I have Learned 
							from doing the assignment so far is that I have figured out a way on how
							to Change from Level to Level, How to make a character jump and I am 
							currently trying to find out on how to get a class that shows text to show 
							it differently in each other world. Also Today I have made the sounds for the
							character when it gets killed, when the game over page shows up, and when you
							succeed in getting past a level. Still I am trying to figure out on how to get
							the text to change in each different world so I didn't have to worry about on
							having way to many class. Below I have Placed some Pictures of the progress of
							the Game That I have built.
